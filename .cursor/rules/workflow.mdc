# Development workflow

After completing each user instruction or logical change:

1. **Update README** – If the change affects setup, behaviour, architecture, or new features, add or edit the relevant section in the project root `README.md` (e.g. new endpoints, new UI flows, exception handling, guards, config).
2. **Git commit and push** – Stage all changes, commit with a **suitable conventional message** (e.g. `feat: add X`, `fix: Y`, `docs: update README for Z`), then push to the remote. Use a short summary line and optional body bullets.

Do not skip these steps unless the user explicitly asks not to update docs or push.
