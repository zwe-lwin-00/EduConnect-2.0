# Workflow: README + Git push after each instruction

After completing any code, config, or UI/UX change:

1. **Update README**  
   - If the change affects setup, behaviour, architecture, or UI/UX, update `README.md` (or `frontend/README.md` where relevant).  
   - Add or adjust sections so the docs stay accurate (e.g. new features, UI standards, env vars).

2. **Commit and push**  
   - Stage the relevant files (including README when updated).  
   - Commit with a **clear, conventional message**, e.g.:  
     - `feat: add error and empty states to Parent student overview`  
     - `fix: modal button order in teacher sessions`  
     - `docs: document frontend UI/UX standards in README`  
   - Push to the current branch.

Use present tense or imperative in the commit message (e.g. "add" not "added"). Keep the message short but specific enough to understand the change from history.
